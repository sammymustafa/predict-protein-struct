# Protein Structure Prediction

Here, I focus on protein structure prediction, an area of critical importance in understanding the functional mechanisms of proteins. I specifically focus on the protein PTEN, employing techniques for contact mapping and structure prediction. Utilizing models such as ESM-6, ESM-150, ESMFold, and AlphaFold2, I utilize a comprehensive approach to predicting protein structures and explore the implications of structure-based sequence design and alignment.

## Key Highlights of Protein Structure Prediction
### 1. Studying PTEN for Contact Mapping:
PTEN, a critical protein in cellular pathways, is analyzed for its structural features. The study involves detailed contact mapping, a fundamental step in understanding protein folding and interaction.

### 2. Predicting Contacts with ESM-6 and ESM-150:
Both ESM-6 and ESM-150 models are employed to predict contact points within the PTEN protein. These predictions are essential for inferring the protein's three-dimensional structure.

### 3. Structure Predictions Using ESMFold and AlphaFold2:
The project leverages ESMFold and AlphaFold2, two advanced tools in protein modeling, to predict the structure of PTEN. These tools represent the cutting-edge in protein structure prediction, offering high accuracy and reliability.

### 4. Structure-Based Sequence Design and Alignment:
Beyond structure prediction, the project also explores structure-based sequence design. This involves aligning sequences based on structural information, providing insights into functional aspects of protein sequences.

## Conclusion: Implications of Advanced Protein Structure Prediction
Overall, this project underscores the significance of advanced techniques in protein structure prediction. The application of models like ESM-6, ESM-150, ESMFold, and AlphaFold2 has demonstrated their effectiveness in accurately predicting the structure of the PTEN protein. These findings are not only pivotal in understanding PTEN's role in cellular pathways but also have broader implications in the field of bioinformatics. The integration of structure-based sequence design and alignment further enriches our understanding of protein functions and interactions. This comprehensive approach to protein structure prediction paves the way for future advancements in the study of other critical proteins.
